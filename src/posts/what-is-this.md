The purpose of this blog - at least for now - is to introduce myself to some newer tech, improved development and design practices, and to keep a record of this journey for posterityðŸ˜‚.

Some of my initial goals here are:

1. To get comfortable with the ins and outs of [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/ "11ty"), a simple but powerful static site generator.
2. Gain a better understanding of performance enhancements for websites. You may have noticed that this blog is pretty fast.
3. Learn how to better use the [jamstack](https://jamstack.org/ "jamstack") and "[serverless](https://serverless.css-tricks.com/ "The Power of Serverless")" tech so as to improve my opportunities to make some dough ðŸ’°!
